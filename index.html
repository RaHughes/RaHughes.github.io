                <h2>Hello. My name is Roger Hughes</h2>
                <p>I've worked in the Web development industry for some time now. It has been one of the most enjoyable</p>
                <p>career paths that I have chosen to work in. I am a Marine Corps, Law Enforcement, Corrections, Armed Security,</p>
                <p>Unarmed Security Veteran. Getting older and starting a family I decided to work in a less dangerous field, but</p>
                <p>still a field that I thoroughly enjoy. I have always had an affinity for creating, and computers. Web Development</p>
                <p>has allowed me to channel that affinity into a rewarding career as a Full Stack Developer.</p>
                <p>Below are some examples of projects I have worked on during</p>
                <p>my time has a full stack web developer</p>
